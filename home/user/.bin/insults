You idiot

“Despite everything, it's still you”
%
Is this a joke? Are you braindead?
%
RUN. INTO. THE. BULLETS!!!
%
You know what's going on here, don't you?
%
I should have killed you when I had the chance
%
It can only be attributed to human error
%
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it
%
There must be a cure for it!
%
Speak English you fool --- there are no subtitles in this scene
%
You do that again and see what happens...
%
That is no basis for supreme executive power!
%
I fart in your general direction!
%
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
%
He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!
