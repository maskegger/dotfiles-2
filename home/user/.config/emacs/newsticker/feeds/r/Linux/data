Arch Linux is known for not being a beginner-friendly distribution, largely due to the fact that the installation process requires a lot of customizations and manual work; however, this is also makes the distro a fertile learning environment. </p> <p>If Arch Linux is approached properly, I feel it is not only feasible for beginners to use Arch Linux, it is actually a more educational introduction to Linux than most other distributions. The key is to move slowly and thoroughly investigate each step of the process to understand what each command is actually doing. </p> <p>Personally, I found creators like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JtheLinuxguy\">LearnLinuxTV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg\">DistroTube</a> invaluable when I was first learning Arch and Linux in general; however, there is an improvement I would like to make on their installation tutorials. I feel their guides are designed to get users up and running with Arch quickly, which necessitates quicker explanations of what each command is doing and the installation of packages that are less than absolutely necessary. </p> <p>So, at the time of posting, I am <a href=\"https://youtu.be/h9xsGWiuGpQ\">live-streaming an Arch Linux installation</a> with the intent of teaching newer users about Linux. We will go over the Arch Wiki&#39;s installation guide with a fine tooth comb to not just execute, but understand every step of the installation process. After the installation is complete, we will tour the OS to see its features and understand the typical OS directory structure.</p> <p>This is a bit of a pedagogical experiment, so I&#39;d love to hear your feedback on the idea.

Arch Linux is known for not being a beginner-friendly distribution, largely due to the fact that the installation process requires a lot of customizations and manual work; however, this is also makes the distro a fertile learning environment. </p> <p>If Arch Linux is approached properly, I feel it is not only feasible for beginners to use Arch Linux, it is actually a more educational introduction to Linux than most other distributions. The key is to move slowly and thoroughly investigate each step of the process to understand what each command is actually doing. </p> <p>Personally, I found creators like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JtheLinuxguy\">LearnLinuxTV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg\">DistroTube</a> invaluable when I was first learning Arch and Linux in general; however, there is an improvement I would like to make on their installation tutorials. I feel their guides are designed to get users up and running with Arch quickly, which necessitates quicker explanations of what each command is doing and the installation of packages that are less than absolutely necessary. </p> <p>So, at the time of posting, I am <a href=\"https://youtu.be/h9xsGWiuGpQ\">live-streaming an Arch Linux installation</a> with the intent of teaching newer users about Linux. We will go over the Arch Wiki&#39;s installation guide with a fine tooth comb to not just execute, but understand every step of the installation process. After the installation is complete, we will tour the OS to see its features and understand the typical OS directory structure.</p> <p>This is a bit of a pedagogical experiment, so I&#39;d love to hear your feedback on the idea. Do you think the Arch installation is too dense to give to beginners, or do you like to learn by jumping in the deep end?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/-HomoDeus-\"> /u/-HomoDeus- </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/mxjinm/arch_linux_for_beginners/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/mxjinm/arch_linux_for_beginners/\">[comments]</a></span>") (id nil "t3_mxjinm") (link ((href .
