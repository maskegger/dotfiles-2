* Intro

Windows is good. macOS is good. Linux is good. BSD is good. There's a
reason people use them. Each person uses the one best for them. But
right now, I'm not. macOS is /not/ the best for me. Windows is /not/ the
best for me. Linux is, but I'm not using it. A Raspberry Pi running
Raspbian isn't enough. I need a /desktop/ system running Linux. And
here's why.

* Job opportunities

First of all, Linux is good for job opportunities. So many of the
servers providing content around the world run Linux or BSD. If you
get to use Linux on a day-to-day basis, you'll learn better than using
it on a Raspberry Pi sitting on your desk. You troubleshoot. You set
up Xorg. Drivers. Configurations. Automation. Linux is a gateway to a
world of programming, administration, automation, and even AI. You get
to learn more about your computer, not locked in by Apple or
Microsoft.

* Customization

Another /huge/ advantage of Linux is customization. On Windows, if I
don't like windows are managed, I deal with it. On macOS, if I don't
like the titlebar, I deal with it. On Linux, however, I can change
/each and every part/ of the system, to fine tune it, to make it the
best for me. I can make my own kernel extensions. My own window
manager. I can compile the kernel to improve performance if I wanted
to. And that's a big part of it. With Linux, you are free to do
whatever you want, with no restrictions. Instead of working for your
system, you make your system work for you. And this leads onto
productivity.

* Productivity

Imagine this. You have 6 windows open. A browser, a code editor, a
debugger, two terminals, and a music app. How do you manage them all?
On Windows or macOS, you try to arrange them manually, fitting into
parts of the screen. On Linux, you use a window manager to
automatically arrange your windows, saving you a ton of time. Linux,
therefore, is more productive.

Another scenario. You have to install some apps, since you're moving
computers. On Windows or macOS, you go from site to site, downloading
EXEs, APPs, MSIs, and DMGs. On Linux, you run a simple command. =pacman
-S chromium teams=. Easy. And fast. Saves you time. /Productive./

* Repairability

You update your system, and suddenly the display is buggy. Bad
drivers. Windows and macOS users would download drivers from the
official site, or rollback the update. Linux users can easily boot
into the command line and reinstall drivers with one command. If
something goes wrong on Linux, you always know how to fix it, unlike
on Windows and macOS.

* Conclusion

Overall, I think that switching to Linux is the best choice for me,
short term /and/ long term. I don't need Apple or Microsoft. Oh, and by
the way, this was written in Emacs, with Org Mode, and exported to
PDF, all with open source tools. Who needs Microsoft Word anyway?
