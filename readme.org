* Dotfiles

Welcome to my virtual home. I wouldn't advise you to blindly copy large parts from these dotfiles, I may be doing some things wrong. However, looking through my configurations and copying some parts, or installing all of the dotfiles together should be fine.

*** Setup

For now, you have to manually install these dotfiles. Soon I'll migrate to [[https://github.com/shade-linux/soul][Soul]] for dotfile management and declarative package management, but till then, everything must be done manually.
